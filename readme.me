Automated Physiotherapy Room Scheduler
Overview
This Google Apps Script project is designed to automate the complex process of creating monthly work schedules for a physiotherapy room. It takes into account a wide range of rules, staff availability, leave requests, and fairness metrics to generate a valid and balanced schedule draft with a single click.

The script is tightly integrated with a Google Sheet that serves as its database and user interface.

Key Features
Rule-Based Generation: The schedule is built based on a comprehensive set of user-configurable rules defined in the ⚙️설정 sheet.

Automated Leave Integration: Automatically blocks out dates for staff members whose leave requests have been approved in the ⛱️휴가신청 sheet.

Fairness Balancing: Ensures work is distributed as evenly as possible, considering:

Total monthly work hours vs. target hours.

The number of on-call shifts per person.

The number of weekend shifts per person.

Constraint Satisfaction: Guarantees adherence to critical constraints like maximum consecutive workdays, minimum rest hours, and special guaranteed OFF blocks (e.g., one Fri+Sat OFF per month).

Holiday Awareness: Can fetch official public holidays for South Korea via an API to correctly categorize days and apply holiday-specific rules.

Developer Tools: Includes a dedicated menu for developers to test individual components of the scheduling engine, ensuring easier debugging and maintenance.

High-Level Architecture
The project follows a modular design pattern, separating concerns into distinct logical units for maintainability and clarity.

/Core: Manages the application's lifecycle, configuration, triggers, and the main orchestration flow.

/Engine: Contains the core algorithms responsible for the actual scheduling logic (e.g., assigning on-call shifts, balancing hours, applying constraints).

/Service: Acts as a bridge between the script and external resources. This includes reading/writing to the Google Sheet and making API calls.

/Util: Provides common, reusable helper functions (e.g., logging, debugging tools).

How to Use
Configure Rules: Ensure all staff information, shift definitions, and scheduling rules are correctly filled out in the ⚙️설정 sheet.

Update Leave: Approve or reject leave requests in the ⛱️휴가신청 sheet.

Generate Schedule: From the spreadsheet menu, navigate to 🗓️ 스케줄 자동생성 > 1. 스케줄 초안 생성.

Review: The script will generate the schedule in the ⭐근무표 sheet and log its actions in the 📈로그 sheet.

Initial Setup
API Key: To use the automatic holiday update feature, you must obtain a free API key from data.go.kr.
