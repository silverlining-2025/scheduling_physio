## 1. Project Overview & Core Philosophy

### 1.1. High-Level Goal

This Google Apps Script application **fully automates** monthly staff scheduling for a hospital‚Äôs physiotherapy room‚Äîturning a complex manual task into a **reliable, one-click** operation.

* **Input:** A Google Sheet containing staff info, rules, vacations/requests.
* **Output:** A completed, **rule-compliant** schedule written back to the same sheet.

### 1.2. Core Philosophy: State-Aware, Proactive Scheduling

The system avoids the common ‚Äúgenerate-then-fix‚Äù pattern. Instead, it is **state-aware** and **proactive**:

* Builds **rich, dynamic profiles** for every staff member and every day.
* Each assignment (e.g., assigning ÏµúÏßÄÌù¨ a `D8`) **instantly updates** both the staff profile and the day profile.
* Before every next decision, the algorithm has a **real-time picture** of: accumulated hours, consecutive workdays, remaining OFF targets, etc.
* This enables **best-possible choices at each step**, so the final schedule is balanced and fair **from the first pass**.

## 2. Glossary of Terms & Nuances

| Term                              | Definition & Nuance                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rich Profile**                  | A JavaScript object for a staff member or a day, holding static attributes **and** live stats updated throughout scheduling.                                 |
| **Context Object**                | The master state for a scheduling run: configuration, all staff profiles, and the grid of daily profiles.                                                    |
| **OFF Day**                       | A scheduled non-work day (not a vacation). The required number is **calculated dynamically** per month.                                                      |
| **Golden Weekend**                | A mandatory **two-day OFF block** (e.g., Fri+Sat) each staff must receive once per month; treated as a **hard constraint** and scheduled early.              |
| **Hospital Shutdown Day (Î≥ëÏõêÌú¥Î¨¥Ïùº)** | Special holiday type from üìÖÏ∫òÎ¶∞Îçî. **Zero** required staff; no work shifts assigned. Distinct from **Í≥µÌú¥Ïùº**, which still requires minimum staffing.             |
| **Shift Categories**              | In ‚öôÔ∏èÏÑ§Ï†ï, shifts are grouped (e.g., ÏùºÎ∞òÍ∑ºÎ¨¥ / Ï£ºÎßêÍ∑ºÎ¨¥). The algorithm uses these to determine **valid shifts per day type**.                                        |
| **Best-Fit Shift**                | Instead of defaulting, the engine selects a shift code (e.g., `D8`, `D6`) that best helps a staff member hit their target hours **for that day‚Äôs category**. |

## 3. The Google Sheet: The System‚Äôs Database

> The Sheet is the **single source of truth** and the primary UI.

| Sheet Name              | Purpose & In-Depth Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **‚öôÔ∏è ÏÑ§Ï†ï (Settings)**    | The **brain** of the scheduler. All configuration is here. <br>‚Ä¢ **A2:A (Ïù¥Î¶Ñ):** Master staff list. <br>‚Ä¢ **E2:H (Í∑ºÎ¨¥ Ïú†Ìòï Ï†ïÏùò):** **Critical.** Defines all valid shift codes; the engine only writes codes listed here. <br>‚Ä¢ **J2:L (Í∑úÏπô ÌÇ§):** All operational rules (legal limits, day-of-week staffing, etc.). The script is **data-driven** by these values. |
| **‚≠ê Í∑ºÎ¨¥Ìëú (Schedule)**    | **Primary output.** <br>‚Ä¢ **B1/C1:** Target year/month (set before running). <br>‚Ä¢ **F3 onward:** Final schedule grid. Also used for visual feedback at the end of each test stage.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **‚õ±Ô∏è Ìú¥Í∞ÄÏã†Ï≤≠ (Vacations)** | Absence input. Only rows with **ÏÉÅÌÉú = ÏäπÏù∏ (Approved)** are considered; others are ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **üìÖ Ï∫òÎ¶∞Îçî (Calendar)**   | Holiday input. The **Íµ¨Î∂Ñ (Category)** column distinguishes **Í≥µÌú¥Ïùº** (requires staff) vs **Î≥ëÏõêÌú¥Î¨¥Ïùº** (requires **zero** staff).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **üìà Î°úÍ∑∏ (Log)**         | Debug output. Cleared and rewritten on every test or full run; receives all operational logs and error messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## 4. The Apps Script Architecture: A Deeper Dive

* **Core_Main.gs**
  Adds a custom menu in the spreadsheet and triggers the Orchestrator when the user runs the scheduler.

* **Engine_Schedule_Orchestrator.gs**
  The **manager** that drives the high-level workflow in order and delegates detail work to services. Best file to read for an end-to-end understanding.

* **Engine_Schedule_Assignment.gs**
  The **specialist** implementing the day-by-day **main loop** with score-based assignment of regular work shifts and OFF days.

* **Service_Sheet.gs**
  Data layer: all reads/writes to the Google Sheet. Includes a **pre-write validation** step to prevent invalid data from reaching ‚≠êÍ∑ºÎ¨¥Ìëú.

* **Service_Logger.gs**
  Aggregates logs during a run and writes them in a single batch to üìàÎ°úÍ∑∏.

* **Service_Debug.gs**
  Testing framework: runs the process in **discrete stages** via the menu; each stage produces detailed logs and visual feedback by writing intermediate state to ‚≠êÍ∑ºÎ¨¥Ìëú.

* **Util_Date.gs**
  Utilities for date formatting, weekend checks, etc.

## 5. The Scheduling Process: Step-by-Step

**The Orchestrator executes stages in this order:**

1. **Stage 1 ‚Äî Context Initialization**
   Read all data; build the **Context Object**; create **Rich Profiles** for every staff and every day.

2. **Stage 2 ‚Äî Target Calculation**
   Compute each staff member‚Äôs **target OFF days** and **target hours** based on the month‚Äôs calendar and their approved vacations.

3. **Stage 3 ‚Äî Pre-Constraint Application**
   Apply **non-negotiable** assignments first:

   * Place approved **Ìú¥Í∞Ä (vacations)**.
   * Assign **Golden Weekend** OFF blocks (one per staff).

4. **Stage 4 ‚Äî Main Generation Loop**
   The Assignment Engine iterates **day by day**, assigning **best-fit** work shifts and remaining OFF days based on its scoring/priority rules.

5. **Stage 5 ‚Äî On-Call (ÎãπÏßÅ) Assignment**
   After the base schedule is complete, scan days requiring on-call duty and **replace** one eligible staff‚Äôs regular shift with **`OC10`**, adjusting hours accordingly.

6. **Stage 6 ‚Äî Final Write**
   Flush the completed schedule from memory (context) to **‚≠êÍ∑ºÎ¨¥Ìëú**.

> **Planned Extension:** See Stage 7 in the next section for post-processing.

## 6. Current Status & Immediate Tasks for AI Agent

### Current Status

* ‚úÖ **6-stage testing framework** is fully operational.
* ‚úÖ The system correctly handles: data ingestion, profile creation, target calculation, pre-constraints, the main generation loop, and **on-call assignments**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Immediate Tasks & Known Issues

#### A) Implement **Final Balancing and Validation** (Stage 7 ‚Äî Post-Processing)

* **Problem:** Some staff may finish slightly **over/under** their target hours.
* **Required Action:** Add a **post-processing** stage **after** on-call assignments. The stage scans the completed schedule and performs small, intelligent adjustments (e.g., `D8 ‚Üí D6` for one person and the reverse for another) to **tighten hour totals** for all staff‚Äî**without violating any rules**.

#### B) Enforce **Paired Weekend Work** Rule

* **Problem:** The `enforce_paired_weekend_work` rule exists in **‚öôÔ∏èÏÑ§Ï†ï**, but the Assignment Engine **does not** enforce it. A staff member can be assigned to **both Saturday and Sunday** of the same weekend.
* **Required Action:** Update **Engine_Schedule_Assignment.gs** so that when considering a staff member for a **weekend** work shift, it checks whether they are already scheduled on the **other day** of the same weekend. If the rule is enabled, **avoid** assigning both days to the same person.

> **Usage Note:** This guide assumes the Google Sheet and Apps Script files already exist. It is intended to help an AI agent quickly understand the system and start implementing the **Stage 7 post-processing** and **paired-weekend enforcement** enhancements.
